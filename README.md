# AIMD-Post-Processing-Toolkit-for-SIESTA
From Stability to Structure, Dynamics, and Transport This repository contains a modular set of Python scripts for post-processing Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations performed with SIESTA. The toolkit enables a complete and physically consistent workflow: MDE → RDF &amp; Coordination → MSD/VACF → Diffusion → Ionic Conductivity
